                            <p>Popular businesses, especially ones that offer mutiple products and services, receive large volume of customer feedback in the form of text reviews. Listening to such feedback is essential for a business to succeed. The aim of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract and aggregate information at the topic level from large volume of customer reviews. Specifically, text reviews from Amazon were used in this project. The model I developed does the following:
                                <ol>
                                <li>Cluster customer reviews based on their content. This helps us learn about customers.</li>
                                <li>Extract high-level information at the topic level for each cluster. Such information can help us improve and/or enhance products/services.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                            <p>Some techniques and algorithms that went into this work include DistilBERT embeddings, sentence tokenization, HDBSCAN clustering, UMAP, TF-IDF, Latent Dirichlet allocation. As the name suggests, DistilBERT is a distilled version of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). It uses 40% fewer parameters and runs 60% faster than BERT, all the while preserving over 95% of BERT's performance.<a href="https://github.com/abiswas20/NLP_to_extract_information_from_reviews"> project link</a></p>

                            <p>New York City has one of the most competitive and expensive real estate in the country. As to be expected, a large portion of the businesses and homes are leased properties. High population density, lack of space for horizontal growth and extensive vertical growth make evictions an unfortunate reality for residents of the city. The goal is exploratory analysis of residents' household income, their level of education and prevalence of certain types of crime in various neighborhoods and how distribution of such factors relate to distribution of evictions per capita.</p>

                        <li> <b>Information Retrieval From Customer Reviews on Amazon:</b> Listening to customers is central to a successful enterprise. However, when we have multiple products/services in the market, or the volume of customer reviews is very large, say >50,000, it can be challenging to keep up with the information. Using natural language processing, I developed a tool to:

                        <li><b>i)</b> Cluster customer reviews based on their content. This helps us learn about customers.</li>

Here are some highlights from my work at Gopher Resource:</p>
			<li> Oversaw process development from lab scale through full production. Managed large plant-scale floor experiments and oversaw process and operational improvements. Facilitated root cause analysis. Supervised external process consultants.</li>
			<li> Designed and implemented process improvements that delivered 80% increase in selenium yield in lead and 90% decrease in selenium in discharged water.</li>
			<li>Developed and implemented new process to make solid waste ‘slag’ created in smelting process non-hazardous, resulting in >70% decrease in volume of hazardous slag.</li>
			<li>Improved lead production outputs with root cause analysis on low production in special circumstances.</li>
            <li>Developed new procedures to collect and analyze accurate data from process design through implementation and maintenance.</li>
                    </ul>

            <li> Conducted research on the development of processes to synthesize TiO2-SiO2 nanofibermats for use in the lunar environment, including synthesis and characterization of nanofibers and filtration properties.</li>
            <li> Developed processes to make more flexible fibermats in comparison to ceramic fibers currently in use.</li>
            <li> Taught undergraduates in materials science and engineering.</li>
