                            <div class="subheading mb-0">Problem Statement</div>
                            <p>In a marketing campaign that offers discounts, there are several factors other than discount rate that play a role in the final value of revenue per transaction. The factors themselves influence each other, further complicating the revenue dynamics. My goal in this project was to develop and deploy an app that can estimate sales value per transaction for liquid milk products, given a set of paramenters. The deployed model utilizes multiple linear regression to capture the dynamics of sales value per transaction. Some factors I took into account are: 
                                <ol>
                                <li>amount and types of discount</li>
                                <li> number of days since start of campaign</li>
				<li>unit volume</li>
				<li>brand</li>
				<li>type of milk</li>
				<li>manufacturer</li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                            <p>I used 'The Complete Journey' dataset, which is publicly available from Dunnhumby, to develop this model. Please note that the app was deployed using Heroku's free tier and may take up to a minute to load the first time.

                            <p>Popular businesses, especially ones that offer mutiple products and services, receive large volume of customer feedback in the form of text reviews. Listening to such feedback is essential for a business to succeed. The aim of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract and aggregate information at the topic level from large volume of customer reviews. Specifically, text reviews from Amazon were used in this project. The model I developed does the following:
                                <ol>
                                <li>Cluster customer reviews based on their content. This helps us learn about customers.</li>
                                <li>Extract high-level information at the topic level for each cluster. Such information can help us improve and/or enhance products/services.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                            <p>Some techniques and algorithms that went into this work include DistilBERT embeddings, sentence tokenization, HDBSCAN clustering, UMAP, TF-IDF, Latent Dirichlet allocation. As the name suggests, DistilBERT is a distilled version of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). It uses 40% fewer parameters and runs 60% faster than BERT, all the while preserving over 95% of BERT's performance.<a href="https://github.com/abiswas20/NLP_to_extract_information_from_reviews"> project link</a></p>

                                In 2018 alone, there were 228,047 car accidents in New York City. The goal of the project is to identify high risk factors within NYC traffic. The final deliverable is a report that:<ol>
                                    <li>Studies the contributing factors and pre-condition.</li>
                                    <li>Examines vehicular collisions data as a time series and build a model to predict number of crashes, and</li>
                                    <li>Create a map of risks, both: spatial and temporal.</li></ol>
                                
                                The motivating factors for creating such a map are:<ol>
                                    <li>first responders can use it to navigate the city during motor Vehicle crashes, natural disaster, and emergencies; and,</li>
                                    <li>it be used by city planers to improve traffic performance and make the roads safer.</li></ol>
                                
                                In our time-series model, we focused on Lincoln tunnel and its surrounding areas. This is because the tunnel serves as one of the major arteries that feeds traffic from New jersey.<a href="https://github.com/abiswas20/crash_dummies"> project link</a>

                            <p>New York City has one of the most competitive and expensive real estate in the country. As to be expected, a large portion of the businesses and homes are leased properties. High population density, lack of space for horizontal growth and extensive vertical growth make evictions an unfortunate reality for residents of the city. The goal is exploratory analysis of residents' household income, their level of education and prevalence of certain types of crime in various neighborhoods and how distribution of such factors relate to distribution of evictions per capita.</p>
                            <p>This study focuses solely on residential properties and their renters. <a href="https://github.com/abiswas20/Data_Sci_Projects/blob/master/Reports/NYC_Evictions_Report/Residential%20Evictions%20in%20New%20York%20City%20-%20Report.ipynb">project link</a></p>

Gained hands-on experience analyzing large real-world datasets and modeling them using various machine learning algorithms. I also added to my experience in exploratory data analysis and translating data to meaningful stories. Here are couple project highlights:</p>
                        
                        <li> <b>Information Retrieval From Customer Reviews on Amazon:</b> Listening to customers is central to a successful enterprise. However, when we have multiple products/services in the market, or the volume of customer reviews is very large, say >50,000, it can be challenging to keep up with the information. Using natural language processing, I developed a tool to:
                        <ul class="fa-ul mb-1">
                        <li><b>i)</b> Cluster customer reviews based on their content. This helps us learn about customers.</li>
                        <li><b>ii)</b> From each cluster extract high-level information at the topic level from the reviews. Such information can help us improve and/or enhance products/services.</li>
                        </li></ul>
                        <li><b> Classify Reddit Comment to Identify Originating Subreddit:</b> Developed a model using natural language processing to classify any randomly selected comment as belonging to one of two very similar subreddits. Model classified comments accurately 96% of the times.</li>

			<li> Oversaw process development from lab scale through full production. Managed large plant-scale floor experiments and oversaw process and operational improvements. Facilitated root cause analysis. Supervised external process consultants.</li>
			<li> Designed and implemented process improvements that delivered 80% increase in selenium yield in lead and 90% decrease in selenium in discharged water.</li>
			<li>Developed and implemented new process to make solid waste ‘slag’ created in smelting process non-hazardous, resulting in >70% decrease in volume of hazardous slag.</li>
			<li>Improved lead production outputs with root cause analysis on low production in special circumstances.</li>
            <li>Developed new procedures to collect and analyze accurate data from process design through implementation and maintenance.</li>
